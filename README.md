# Project Title: Blackjack Game

This project is a simple command-line version of the classic card game "Blackjack". It allows a player to play against the dealer (computer) and try to get as close to 21 points without going over. 

## How to Install and Run the Project
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where you downloaded/cloned the repository.
4. Type `python blackjack.py` in the terminal/command prompt to start the game.

## How to Use the Project
1. Upon starting the game, you will be dealt two cards face up, while the dealer will be dealt one card face up and one card face down.
2. You will be prompted to choose whether you want to "Hit" (draw another card) or "Stand" (end your turn).
3. If your total score goes over 21, you lose ("Bust").
4. If you choose to "Stand", the dealer will continue to draw cards until their total score is 17 or higher.
5. If the dealer's total score goes over 21, you win.
6. If your total score is higher than the dealer's and does not exceed 21, you win.
7. If the dealer's total score is higher than yours and does not exceed 21, you lose.
8. If your total score and the dealer's total score are the same, the game is a draw.
